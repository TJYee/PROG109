        Apocalypse Today is a world leader in conspiracy theories, dour predictions,
        and panic-spreading. Our motto is "be prepared for every possibility (except the
        good ones)."<br>

        <p>Right now, you're probably feeling pretty good. After all,
         life in the developed world is comfortable  &mdash; probably more
         comfortable than it's been for the average human being throughout all of recorded
         history.</p>

        <p>But don't get too smug. There's still plenty of horrific ways it
        could all fall apart. In this article, you'll learn about a few of our
        favorites.</p>
        
        <h3>Mayan Doomsday</h3>
        <p>Skeptics suggest that the Mayan calendar simply rolls to a new
        5,126-year era after 2012, and doesn't actually predict a life-ending
        apocalypse. But given that the long-dead Mayans were wrong about
        virtually everything else, why should we trust them on this?
        </p>
        
        <h3>Robot Takeover</h3>
        <p>Not quite as frightening as a Vampire Takeover or Living-Dead
        Takeover, a robot rebellion is still a disquieting thought. We are
        already outnumbered by our technological gadgets, and even Bill Gates
        fears the day his Japanese robot slave turns him over by the ankles
        and asks (in a suitably robotic voice) "Who's your daddy now?"
        </p>
        
        <h3>Unexplained Singularity</h3>
        <p>We don't know how the universe started, so we can't be sure it won't
        just end, maybe today, and maybe with nothing more exciting than a
        puff of anti-matter and a slight fizzing noise.</p>
        
        <h3>Runaway Climate Change</h3>
        <p>Dismissed by some, Al Gore's prophecy of doom may still come true. If
        it does, we may have to contend with vicious storms, widespread food
        shortages, and surly air conditioning repairmen.</p>
        
        <h3>Global Epidemic</h3>
        <p>Some time in the future, a lethal virus could strike. Predictions
        differ about the source of the disease, but candidates include
        monkeys in the African jungle, bioterrorists, birds and pigs with the
        flu, warriors from the future, an alien race, hospitals that use too
        many antibiotics, vampires, the CIA, and unwashed brussel sprouts.
        Whatever the source, it's clearly bad news.</p>
